json-ld.net (PREVIEW)
==========

A JSON-LD processor for .NET. This is a preview release.

Notes
=====
This is the very first mostly working build of json-ld.net.

It began life as a [Sharpen][sharpen]-based auto-port from [jsonld-java][jsonld-java].

A few known tasks remain before 1.0:

* W3C conformance test runner/results.
* RemoteDocument fetching is disabled (for remote contexts, e.g.).
* Quite a few minor bugs remain to be fixed.
